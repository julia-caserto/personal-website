abstract: "Biodegradable elastomers are important emerging biomaterials for biomedical applications, particularly in the area of soft-tissue engineering in which scaffolds need to match the physicochemical properties of native tissues. Here, we report novel fast photocurable elastomers with readily tunable mechanical properties, surface wetta-bility, and degradability. These elastomers are prepared by a 5-min UV-irradiation of thiol-ene reaction systems of glycerol tripentenoate (GTP; a triene) or the combination of GTP and 4-pentenyl 4-pentenoate (PP; a diene) with a carefully chosen series of di-or tri-thiols. In the subsequent application study, these elastomers were found to be capable of overcoming delamination of myotubes, a technical bottleneck limiting the in vitro growth of mature functional myofibers. The glycerol-based elastomers supported the proliferation of mouse and human myoblasts, as well as myogenic differentiation into contractile myotubes. More notably, while beating mouse myotubes detached from conventional tissue culture plates, they remain adherent on the elastomer surface. The results suggest that these elastomers as novel biomaterials may provide a promising platform for engineering functional soft tissues with potential applications in regenerative medicine or pharmacological testing."
