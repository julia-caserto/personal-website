abstract: "Automated delivery of insulin based on continuous glucose monitoring is revolutionizing the way insulin-dependent diabetes is treated. However, challenges remain for the widespread adoption of these systems, including the requirement of a separate glucose sensor, sophisticated electronics and algorithms, and the need for significant user input to operate these costly therapies. Herein, a user-centric glucose-responsive cannula is reported for electronics-free insulin delivery. The cannula—made from a tough, elastomer-hydrogel hybrid membrane formed through a one-pot solvent exchange method—changes permeability to release insulin rapidly upon physiologically relevant varying glucose levels, providing simple and automated insulin delivery with no additional hardware or software. Two prototypes of the cannula are evaluated in insulin-deficient diabetic mice. The first cannula—an ends-sealed, subcutaneously inserted prototype—normalizes blood glucose levels for 3 d and controls postprandial glucose levels. The second, more translational version—a cannula with the distal end sealed and the proximal end connected to a transcutaneous injection port—likewise demonstrates tight, 3-d regulation of blood glucose levels when refilled twice daily. This proof-of-concept study may aid in the development of “smart” cannulas and next-generation insulin therapies at a reduced burden-of-care toll and cost to end-users."
